# RPG
An old-school, text-based RPG game in which the player (a hero) battles enemies, interacts with NPCs, and collects resources in an effort to stay alive as long as possible. 

## Gameplay

## Objective
The game will only end when the hero dies. Thus, the overarching objective of the game is to **stay alive as long as possible**. In addition, the hero will try to gather/improve defense, health, and attack power as much as he/she can. The aforementioned attributes can be improved by means of killing other enemies, finding resources in the environment, or by trading with any NPC. The player’s “score” is determined by the amount of gold collected and number of enemies killed during battle.

## Fun Fact
The game parallels occurrences in my life. All the characters will be iterations of someone that I know. The problems that the hero encounters will be based on obstacles that I myself face or have faced.
